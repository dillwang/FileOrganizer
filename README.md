# FileOrganizer
The FileOrganizerApp is a Java program that helps you organize your files. The zipped file includes 3 files: `FileOrganizerApp.jar` is the main app; `json-20230618.jar` is the library that the app uses; `config.json` is a user-editable file for further customization. The FileOrganizerApp categorizes files based on their extension names. It features a directory browsing function that allows you to find exactly where you want to organize your files. It will also create new folders on its own if you do not have the folder you want created already. You can edit the `config.json` file to customize how you would like your files to be categorized. The `config.json` file uses the format of `"extension name": "folder"`. It is recommended that you copy the previous format and only edit the names. All the lines are separated by commas except for the last row.
