# FileOrganizer
The FileOrganizerApp is a Java program that helps you organize your files. It has a directory browsing function that allows you to find exactly where you want to organize your files. It categorizes files based on their extension names. It will also create new folders on its own if you do not have the folder you want created already. You can edit the `config.json` file to customize how you would like your files to be categorized. The `config.json` file uses the format of `"extension name": "folder"`. It is recommended that you copy the previous format and only edit the names. All the lines are separated by commas except for the last row.

PS: This is my first project, please feel free to give me any feedback, recommendations, and or bug reports. Thank you!
